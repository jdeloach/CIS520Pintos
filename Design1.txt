                 ALARM CLOCK
                 ===========

src/devices/timer.c
static struct list wait_list;
	Holds the list of waiting threads to be woken up.

src/threads/thread.h
struct thread
	defines a thread and all its properties
	changed - added
		struct semaphore wait_sem;
			keeps track of if the thread has been blocked or not
		struct list_elem wait_elem;



---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to your timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

	We add the thread to the waiting list, then set the wait_time for the thread.
	We use a semaphore to block thread, so once the wait time has been set, we initialize the wait_sem to 0, and call sema_down effectively blocking the thread.
	Each time the timer interrupt is called, it searches the the wait_list for any threads that have a expired wait time and call sema_up on their wait_sems waking them back up.


>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
	
	The threads have been given a wake time, and the timer interrupt simply compares that wake time to the current time, and it the wakes the thread if the wake time has expired, as opposed to setting a number of ticks to decrement in the thread and decrementing the ticks for each thread that has been sleeping.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

	We disable interrupts when updating the wait_list, so that we are sure that the wait_list is updated properly.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?
	
	As mentioned interrupts are disabled whe updating wait_list, so if it is called during that time nothing happens.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> other designs that you considered?

	We chose this design because semaphores are a fast way of handling thread_sleeping. It saves time in the timer interrupt because now the interrupt just keeps track of who needs to be woken and does not calculate anything in the threads.

	Other designs involved setting a ticks value which the timer interrupt decremented for each thread and then checked which threads were at 0. We thought this would have too much over head.


             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

	We maintain a sorted lists of threads waiting to be woken up.
	These lists are sorted according to priority so that the highest priority are always at the front.

	For a semaphore, when sema_up is called, the list of waiters is sorted and the first thread woken up.
	Locks depend on semaphores, so because the waiters for a semaphore are sorted, the lock functions in the same way.
	Thus for both semaphores and locks, we maintain a list of threads, sorted using a sorting function which sorts from greatest to least.

	The condition variable works a little different, because it maintains a list of semaphores, each having one thread waiting on it. 
	We have to sort this list of semaphores according to the threads waiting on them.
	We have a separate sorting function which sorts semaphores based on the priority of the threads waiting on them.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?



>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
